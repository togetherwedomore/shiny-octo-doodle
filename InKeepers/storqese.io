I'm using the buy button code to 
embed on a wix site. I'm looking to
 only have the cart show up 
(with continuity) on some of the 
pages that aren't product-specific. 
(e.g., if someone goes to the storqese
"About" page after adding something to the storqese.io cart,
 I want them to be easily able to find the cart and check out). 
Need to understand which part of the
 code can help me do this. + adding migration
